=======================GOOD SO FAR============================
Ray
Vector3D
Matrix
GeometricObject (has commented out functions)
ShadeRec (idk what the commented out include statements are)
Plane
Sphere
Triangle (has commented out BBox)
World (didn't type Renderer from github, do setters and getters need to delete old pointers?, display_pixel gamma value input)
	World::render_scene() needs to have sampler support added
Tracer
Camera
Pinhole (need to implement roll)
Orthographic (need to implement roll)
Light (what is bool shadows?)
Directional
Ambient
Point
GlossySpecular (Vector& wi in sample_f is not const?, Also implement samplers, rho is not const Vector&)
Compound

Point, Direction (shadow hit not used, dummy ShadeRec used)
GeometricObjects (shadow_hit() not implemented)
Lights (set_shadows(bool) to control shadow possibilities)


===========CAR TODO======================
Bounding box in object constructors
bvh



======================POSSIBLY IMPLEMENT============================
Samplers
Thin Lens Camera (requires sampling...)
Shadow Hit -> slighlty optimized b/c it stops as soon as it hits something
Emmissive


========================MP SPECIFICATIONS===========================

MP1:
--Orthographic Projection
--Perspective Projection
--Sampling
--Shading (Diffuse) w/ directional light

MP2:
--OBJ & PLY
--Spatial Data Structure (KD-Tree, BVH, Octree)
--Shadows
--Point Lights
--Phong Shading -> Diffuse AND Specular

--Renders (Lots of spheres, triangle mesh) w/ shadows, phong, point lights
--Report (1 para, table w/ time to render)
----Mesh w/o acceleration
----Mesh w/ acceleration
----3 Scenes of different magnitude of spheres

--Readme.txt (all code I didn't write / adapted)


============================QUESTIONS==============================
--clone?
--virtual?
--mutable?
--forward declarations? (See book shaderec.h)
--pass by const reference?
--class protection
--world.cpp -> why do delete_objects call objects.erase()
--setters and getters for super classes (makes it a bit easier when inheritence is big so you don't have add fields to subclass constructors
--Initializer lists format
--Order of big 5/6 (def, reg, copy, destr, ass, clone)
--Include statements order
--Make everything getters and setter? Or is that too slow?
--When to use doubles and floats
--Should primitives be passed as const & ? or just regularly?
--Are structs & typedef better than Object Oriented Classes?
