CODE CITATIONS:

Nearly all of the code I wrote in the ray tracer was heavily taken from the Ray Tracing From the Ground Up book by Kevin Suffern. However, I re-typed all of this code by hand / line-by-line. I did this to understand the code better and make it more similar to my coding style / deleted things I thought were unnecessary.
